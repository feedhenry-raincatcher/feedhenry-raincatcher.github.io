= {WFM-RC-NameLong} Datasync

As with all synchronisation tasks Datasync is made up of a cloud and client sides. 
The cloud is implemented with the Datasync cloud module and client is implemented with the Datasync client module. 
These are a implementation of the Sync Framework for advanced usage see the 
link:{WFM-RC-SyncFrameworkURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/docs[sync framework documentation]. 
The primary funtion of Datasync is to synchronise mobile data between mobile(client) and a backend server(cloud).
The key features of Datasync are as follows:

- Allows synchronisation of WFM workorder data between the {WFM-RC-NameLong} mobile client and the {WFM-RC-NameLong} cloud server.
- Allows mobile apps to use and update data offline (local cache)
- Provides a mechanism to manage bi-directional data synchronization from multiple Client Apps via the Cloud App and into back-end data stores
- Allows data updates (that is, deltas) to be distributed from the Cloud App to connected clients
- Provides facilities for managing data collisions from multiple updates in the cloud

This service effectively allows Sync Apps to seamlessly continue working when the network connection is lost, and allow them to recover when the network connection is restored.

== {WFM-RC-NameLong} Datasync cloud
Datasync cloud has to be used in conjunction with the Datasync client applications.
{WFM-RC-NameLong} Datasync cloud is a wrapper for the  link:https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-sync[Datasync server].
This module creates server side service that allows mobile applications to sync offline data to preferred database.
By default server connects and stores all client data in mongodb database. 

=== Implementation of {WFM-RC-NameLong} Datasync cloud

See the link:{WFM-RC-CoreURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/cloud/datasync/README.md[README.MD] for instructions on implementation of the Datasync cloud.

See a usage at link:{WFM-RC-CoreUrl}{WFM-RC-Branch}/cloud/datasync/example/index.ts[example].


== {WFM-RC-NameLong} Datasync client 
Datasync client requres a Express web server running Datasync Cloud. Data synchonization Library can be used for offline storage 
of mobile applications data.
{WFM-RC-NameLong} Datasync client is based on link:https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-sync-js[sync.js client].

== Implementation of {WFM-RC-NameLong} Datasync client 
See the link:{WFM-RC-CoreURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/client/datasync-client/README.md[README.MD] for instructions on implementation of the Datasync client.
